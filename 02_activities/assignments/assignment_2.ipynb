Practicing how to effectively explain both the problem and solution is important for technical interviews. Conducting a code review of another personâ€™s work is also a great method to train for working with software in a team setting. It allows you to scrutinize coding practices that one might not notice within their own work. The thorough study of the two problems and their solutions was a good overview of the concepts of algorithms and data structures."
